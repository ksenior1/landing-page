                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    The history of the 7th Engineer Battalion dates back to the American Civil War. It was first organized as a provisional engineer battalion on December 31, 1861 in the Regular Army in Washington D.C. from a series of new and existing companies of engineers. The battalion was finally constituted as the Battalion of Engineers on July 28th 1866.

                    After the Civil War the battalion was credited for participation in the Spanish American War at Santiago, Cuba in 1898.

                    The Battalion continued to expand over the years and by August 29, 1917, the unit was designated the 7th Engineers. Later that Fall in November 1917, the battalion joined the 5th Infantry Division as part of the American-Expeditionary Forces in Europe during World War I. The unit distinguished it self at Alsace-Lorraine, St. Mihiel and Meusse-Argonne. Most notably, the battalion established the bridgehead under heavy artillery fire on the eastern bank of the Meuse River, with seven seperate crossing, a critical action that enabled victory in Europe.

                    In response to World War II, the unit was redesignated the 7th Engineer Battalion and activated on October 16, 1939 at Fort Logan Colorado. The unit made 25 major river crossings during World War II. At the Moselle Bridgehead, the Battalion built 3 bridges, one long enough for a division to cross. At the Sauer River crossing, the engineers deactivated 1,500 mines in less than 2 hours enabling an infantry regiment to advance.

                    After World War II the battalion remained associated with the 5th Infantry division. Subordinated units of the battalion participated in both Vietnam and Panama. The battalion was deactivated in 1992 at Fort Polk, Louisiana.

                    As part of the effort to grow the Engineer Regiment during the Global War on Terrorism, the 7th Engineer Battalion was reactivated on October 17, 2006 at Fort Drum, New York.

                The heights by great men reached and kept were not attained by sudden flight, 
                but they, while their companions slept, were toiling upward in the night.
